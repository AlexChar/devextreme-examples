# DevExtreme Examples

A set of sample applications that will help you get started with DevExtreme.
Â 
Each example holds a simple application containing a dxButton widget with an alert dialog. It is enough to demonstrate how to link the required DevExtreme modules to the application using RequireJS, webpack or jspm with jQuery, AngularJS or Knockout approach. All examples require Node.js and npm to install [DevExtreme](http://js.devexpress.com/) package and its dependencies. Basic principles of working with these tools would be also helpful.
